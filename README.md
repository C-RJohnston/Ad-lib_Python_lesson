Students will write a program for an adlib story. They will be given a selection of stories with blanks in at certain points, or can create their own if they are feeling confident, and will be tasked with making a program that prompts the user for a series of words and then displays their story with the words filled in.
This will teach students

•	The IO stream

•	f strings

and optionally

•	conditional statements

•	ternary operators

•	the game loop


An example of the lesson is included and an example of what the students should produce is shown in democode.py and an example of the lesson plan is shown in Lesson_Plan.pdf
The adlib story used in the examples is from http://lessonplanofhappiness.com/print/harrypotter/hogwarts_story.pdf
